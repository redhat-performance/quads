      "message": "This is actually a very substantial change to push into latest but since we\u0027ve essentially been running HEAD the entire time since 2.0 was released I think it\u0027s fine, in other words there is no turning back.\n\nIn a pinch we could create a branch off the 2.0.5 git tag to spin an RPM but let\u0027s hope that\u0027s not needed, I feel like if that was needed we\u0027d already seen it after dozens and dozens of assignments have already gone out.\n\nWe\u0027re going to be in a weird state when this is pushed because the RPM code/content and application workflows have had a major piece removed and reworked.  This means the docs once pushed will essentially be ahead of the published package so we might consider just spinning a 2.1.0 very soon to close this window.",
