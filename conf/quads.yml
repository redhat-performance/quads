# pxe boot selection
# if nullos is set to true: PXE flag removed for Foreman

# if nullos is set to false: machine still foreman provisionable
# and is excluded from instackenv.json.  It can then be
# either used as an undercloud or something else and the
# traditional default 1st host in an assignment is put back
# in the pile and included in instackenv.json
