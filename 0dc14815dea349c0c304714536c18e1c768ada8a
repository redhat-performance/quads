      "message": "Really nice set of refactor improvements Tom.  It may seem cosmetic but if we can still keep bin/quads-cli binary and path it\u0027s so much muscle memory by now and \u0027quads-cli\u0027 just feels more targeted and complete (one can always alias this locally if they want - most people do so via \u0027quads\u0027 but \u0027cli\u0027 is a little too generic ðŸ˜Š )\n\nSo you won\u0027t have to keep rebasing against master branch you might think about shelving this and working out of your own branch via \u0027git checkout -b $somename\u0027 - might make things easier to merge later.\n\nI really like the targeting of if/elif conditionals with a more Pythonic structure here.",

      "message": "Hey Will, I might be missing something there but the path to quads-cli is still the same, the entrypoint of the whole CLI is still `bin/quads-cli` file it\u0027s just that the heavy lifting code was moved into quads module and `bin/quads-cli` imports from it.\n\nAbout the rebasing, I am doing something like that in github and then squashing the commits there to form patches for gerrit, though I missed that I opened the gerrit change against master, will look into it.",
