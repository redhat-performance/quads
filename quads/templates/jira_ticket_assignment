Hello,

Your assignment has been scheduled into QUADS with the following future run times:

start = {{ schedule_start }} UTC
end   = {{ schedule_end }} UTC
cloud = {{ cloud }}

You will be receiving a series of automated email notifications up through the start of your assignment with more information.
When your assignment is ready (and automated network validation has occurred) you'll receive a final all clear notification with access information.

In the meantime you can find more information here:

http://docs.scalelab.redhat.com/trac/scalelab/wiki/ScaleLabTipsAndTricks

Here is a list of your tentatively scheduled future hosts (subject to change).
They will not be active until you receive a final notification sometime soon after your assigned start date.

PLEASE NOTE: DO NOT start utilizing your machines right away, they need to be validated first.
The assignment start time is when they start to be provisioned and allocated to you and could take some time longer if there are hardware issues which need to be addressed.
We do automated network validation as well, and all of these things must pass before they are ready for you to use.

The general availability is estimated to be 2-3 hours after your start date unless intervention is required.  Either way you'll receive a final email letting you know.
