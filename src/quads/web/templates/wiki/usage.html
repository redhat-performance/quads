								<p>The purpose of the Scale Lab and the
									<a class="link-secondary-hover-no-decoration" href="https://quads.dev"
									   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QUADS</a>
									scheduler is to automate all aspects of machine and network provisioning to provide

									products
									for short-term workloads.</p>
								<p>There are just a few guidelines to using resources within the environment:</p>

											</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>We have a very specific naming convention that helps us know where a
													server is located, what rack, U-location and type. This helps us
													quickly address any physical hardware issues or problems that might
													arise. While renaming your machine doesn&#8217;t affect DNS records
													it may cause confusion when reporting issues.
												</li>
												<li>Please also <strong>do not rename servers</strong>
													<strong>in Foreman</strong>, this will affect DNS/DHCP records and
													cause issues for us and other tenants in the lab.

												<li>There is really no reason anyone needs to make BIOS level changes,

													machines/networks to people that need them. If you think you need to

													if you&#8217;re in this situation please mention it on your Scale
													Lab assignment request form and we&#8217;ll ensure you have what you

													try to consult us first if you think something needs to be changed.
													At the least please revert any changes made before your assignment
													ends and your work is complete.
												</li>
												<li>If you&#8217;re looking for a way to blacklist or disable some

													DHCP/PXE/TFTP services on the primary (public facing 10.1.x)
													interface on all of the machines. Running any sort of DHCP/PXE or
													Multicast traffic here can be disruptive to the entire lab. You will

													their own VLAN for segregated layer2 traffic to do whatever you
													like. As a courtesy we also lay down 172.16.x interface configs for
													you to use in this manner across the internal interfaces.

												<li>While we&#8217;re happy to provide advice we do not setup or manage

													bare-metal systems and network problems. Once you receive your
													machines they are yours to configure, setup and run your workloads.
													The high level of automation and rapid provisioning, hand-off and
													reclamation of assets doesn&#8217;t lend to supporting anything
													beyond the operating system or self-service provisioning. There are
													efforts underway to automatically deploy some common application
													stacks like OpenStack automatically via QUADS when you get your
													systems but this is not in place yet.

												<li>Scale Lab is designed for already-proven workloads that need to be
													tested at a higher scale. This isn&#8217;t the right environment for
													small-scale or untested R&amp;D sandbox development as allocations
													are short-term. For example you might discover bugs in a product on
													a small set of Eng-Ops provided hardware and need to prove this on
													faster networks and larger machine counts.

												<li>We currently have a minimum request limit of 10 machines, if you
