will change.  As host schedules are activated some
hosts will automatically be reprovisioned and moved to
your environment.  This could also mean that one or more
hosts will evacuate your environment ahead of others.

QUADS has detected a change in schedule to the following
hosts:

{% for host in hosts %}
{{host}}
{% endfor %}
