Hello,

This is a message to alert you that on a request you made for an extension or an expansions, we failed to add watchers
from the main request for Scale Lab access to this new sub-task JIRA ticket.
To add yourself as a watcher and potentially others, try to please do so manually, the aforementioned ticket: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SCALELAB-{{ ticket }}

Thank you for your attention.
