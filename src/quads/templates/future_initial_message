Greetings Citizen,

You've been allocated a new future environment!  The environment
is not yet ready for use but you are being notified ahead of time
that it is being prepared.

{{ cloud_info }}

When your environment is ready and your hardware/network has
passed automated validation it will be released to you.

You'll receive another email with environment-specific
information and additional system details when it's ready.

Before this happens a future schedule will be entered and
communicated to you via your service ticket/request.

Afterwards, when the time comes a series of automated tests and
validation phases will occur to make sure your systems/network
are in their final, desired state before being ready to use.
