QUADS Metadata Model and Search Library
======================================

In QUADS `1.1.4` and above we've implemented a metadata model in the QUADS database that captures information about host hardware, model, and other useful information.  We'll be expanding this as time progresses.

## How to Import Host Metadata
  * Host metadata can be gathered by both editing and importing YAML files or directly via `lshw` locally on each host or remotely en-masse.

### Gathering Metadata via lshw Tools Locally
  * We can use the popular [lshw](https://linux.die.net/man/1/lshw) tool to gather hardware details into JSON
  * We ship a tool called `lshw2meta.py` to transform this into a format for updating host metadata into QUADS.

First, install `lshw` on your target QUADS-managed host(s)

```
dnf install lshw
```

Next run `lshw` to capture all the hardware details of each remote host in JSON.

```
lshw -json > $(hostname).json
```

Next, copy the JSON file(s) over to your QUADS host here: `quadshost:/opt/quads/lshw/`

Now, back on your QUADS host use the `lshw2meta.py` tool to convert this data and import it directly into the QUADS database for each host.

```
python3 /usr/lib/python3.12/site-packages/quads/tools/lshw2meta.py
```

### Gathering Metadata via lshw Tools Remotely
  * We also provide an `lshw.py` tool which can be used to gather `lshw` JSON data remotely over SSH
  * This assumes you have root SSH keys on each remote system.
  * This assumes all of your hosts are in `cloud01` and powered on and accessible
  * This assumes you have `lshw` installed as well on every remote host

First, gather all of the JSON metadata from your remote QUADS-managed host(s):
```
python3 /usr/lib/python3.12/site-packages/quads/tools/lshw.py
```

Now import them all via `lshw2meta.py`
```
python3 /usr/lib/python3.12/site-packages/quads/tools/lshw2meta.py
```

### Modify YAML Host Data
  * Host metadata uses a standard YAML key/value pair format, here's a [reference example](../conf/hosts_metadata.yml)
  * Host metadata is not required unless you want to use it, **it is entirely optional**

### Add any Supporting Model Type
  * We list some example model types of baremetal systems we use, you will also want to edit the `models:` value so it has any additional system models you might use in the [QUADS Conf](../conf/hosts_metadata.yml#L238)
  * To generate a YAML metadata file for importing QUADS-managed hosts you can use this command:

```
for h in $(quads --ls-hosts) ; do echo "- name: $h" ; echo "  model: $(echo $h | awk -F. '{ print $1 }' | awk -F- '{ print $NF }' | tr a-z A-Z)" ; done > /tmp/hosts_metadata.yml
```

### Importing Host Metadata

  * To import host metadata from a file:

```
quads --define-host-details --metadata /tmp/hosts_metadata.yml
```

  * Doing this again or modifying your `hosts_metadata.yml` file and re-importing will overwrite all values or remove ones that might have been removed from the QUADS database.

## How to Export Host Metadata
  * To export the same formatted YAML key/value pair metadata data source from your hosts use the `--export-host-details` command.
  * The file provided should be a new file, or overwrite an existing one and the path should be somewhere on the filesystem.

```
quads --export-host-details /tmp/my_host_data.yml
```

## Querying Host Information
  * The sub-command `--filter` can be used with `--ls-available` and `--ls-hosts` commands.

### Example Filter Searches
  * Accepted operators are `==, !=, <, <=, >, >=`

#### Example Hardware Filter Searches

  * Search for systems with disk type NVMe, with a size of 2TB or more and available between `2020-07-20 17:00` and `2020-07-22 13:00`

```
quads --ls-available --schedule-start "2020-07-20 17:00" --schedule-end "2020-07-22 13:00" --filter "disks.disk_type==nvme,disks.size_gb>=2000"
```

  * Search for systems with SATA disks available from `2020-07-20 17:00` until `2020-07-22 13:00`

```
quads --ls-available --schedule-start "2020-07-20 17:00" --schedule-end "2020-07-22 13:00" --filter "disks.disk_type==sata"
```

  * Search for systems of model type `1029U-TRTP` available from `2020-07-20 17:00` until `2020-07-22 13:00`

```
quads --ls-available --schedule-start "2020-07-20 17:00" --schedule-end "2020-07-22 13:00" --filter "model==1029U-TRTP"
```

  * Search for systems with **two NVMe** disks **and** disk size of **more than** 2TB, available from `2020-07-20 17:00` until `2020-07-22 13:00`

```
quads --ls-available --schedule-start "2020-07-20 17:00" --schedule-end "2020-07-22 13:00" --filter "disks.disk_type==nvme,disks.count>2, disks.size_gb<2000"
```

  * Search all systems by model and number of interfaces.

```
quads --ls-hosts --filter "model==FC640,interfaces__size==5"
```

#### Example Network Filter Searches

  * Find a host by MAC Address.
  * This is useful for finding what host has what MAC Address.

```
quads --ls-hosts --filter "interfaces.mac_address==ac:1f:6b:2d:19:48"
```

  * Find hosts by switch IP address.
  * Shows all hosts connected to a particular switch

```
quads --ls-host --filter "interfaces.ip_address==10.1.34.216"
```

  * Find hosts by physical switchport
  * Shows all hosts that have a specific physical switchport name

```
quads --ls-host --filter "interfaces.switch_port==et-0/0/7:1"
```

##### Combined Network Search Example

  * Like other filter strings you can combine elements together.
  * Example: Search for a host by physical switchport **and** switch IP address.

```
quads --ls-hosts --filter "interfaces.ip_address==10.1.34.216,interfaces.switch_port==et-0/0/7:1"
```

## Querying Host Status
* We will be adding features to query host status in addition to hardware metadata/details.
* Functionality here may include retirement/decomission status and other useful attributes.

### Example Status Filter Searches

  * List all systems by retirement (decomission) status.

```
quads --ls-hosts --filter "retired==True"
```

  * List retired hosts and filter by model

```
quads --ls-hosts --filter "retired==True,model==1029P"
```
