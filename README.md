QUADS
=====
![quads](/image/quads.png)

QUADS automates the future scheduling, end-to-end provisioning and delivery of bare-metal servers and networks.

QUADS also provides a robust, RESTful API that enables end-to-end self service delivery and a [Python client library](https://github.com/quadsproject/python-quads-lib)

   - Drive automated systems provisioning and network switch changes to deliver isolated, multi-tenant bare-metal environments
   - Automated network and provisioning validation prior to delivering sets of machines/networks to tenants
   - Automated allocation of optional, publicly routable VLANs
   - Generates/maintains user-configurable [instackenv.json](https://docs.openstack.org/tripleo-docs/latest/install/environments/baremetal.html#instackenv-json) to accomodate ironic-based OpenStack/OpenShift deployments.
   - Generates/maintains user-configurable ocpinventory.json for OpenShift on Baremetal Deployments
   - Automatically generate/maintain documentation to illustrate current status
     * Current system details, infrastructure fleet inventory
     * Current system group ownership (cloud), workloads and assignments
     * Total duration and time remaining in system assignments
     * Dynamic provisioning & system/network validation status per assignment
     * Currently allocated/free optional publicly routable VLAN status
   - Query scheduling data to determine future availability
   - Generates a per-month visualization map for per-machine allocations to assignments.
   - JIRA integration.
   - Chat webhook and IRC notifications for system releases.
   - Email notifications to users for new future assignments, releases and expirations.
   - Flask-based Web UI for searching for available bare-metal systems in the future based on model and hardware.
   - Open, RESTful JSON API and RBAC for controlling access
   - Full-featured API for self-service scheduling of systems/assignments

## Design
   - Main components: `Python3, Flask, SqlAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Jinja2`
   - Installation via RPM for Fedora Linux.
   - We use [Badfish](https://github.com/quadsproject/badfish) for managing bare-metal IPMI
   - We use [Foreman](https://theforeman.org/) for the systems provisioning backend.
   - We also provide a standalone [Python client library](https://python-quads-lib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/readme.html#installation) for interacting with the QUADS framework programmatically.
   - A typical QUADS deployment might look like this:

![quadsarchitecture](/image/quads-architecture.jpg)

## Requirements
   - Recent [Fedora Server](https://fedoraproject.org/server/download/) for RPM installations
   - 1 x modest sized VM (8 vcpu 8GB mem) for combined QUADS stack (quads-server, quads-web, quads-db)
   - The scheduling functionality can be used standalone, but you'll want a provisioning backend like [Foreman](https://theforeman.org/) to take full advantage of QUADS scheduling, automation and provisioning capabilities.
   - Switch/VLAN automation is done on Juniper Switches in [Q-in-Q VLANs](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/multicast-l2/topics/topic-map/q-in-q.html#id-example-setting-up-qinq-tunneling-on-qfx-series-switches), but command sets can be extended to support other network switch models as future RFE's.  Any switch platform that supports industry-standard [802.1Q](https://info.support.huawei.com/info-finder/encyclopedia/en/QinQ.html) [IEEE spec](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.1Q/6844/) in layer 2 can theoretically work.  Q-in-Q is an IEEE [amendment](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.1ad/3374/) to 802.1ad originally.
   - For QUADS to manage bare-metal systems **they must support IPMI 2.0 or higher and the [Redfish API](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish)** in their out-of-band implementation.  This is used for power actions, user RBAC and other features.  Dell (preferred), SuperMicro and HPE have been used in our environments.  Most enterprise server vendors come standard with IPMI interfaces and the [Redfish API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redfish_(specification)).

## QUADS Terminology

### What is a Cloud
* A `cloud` is a defined static environment / slot where workloads run in an isolated multi-tenant context.
* Clouds are [defined ahead of time](/docs/switch-host-setup.md#greenfield-tor-switch-configuration) and correspond to sets of unique L2 VLANs
* They are re-defined and re-purposed for future workloads via metadata e.g. `--description` `--cloud-owner` `--cloud-ticket` etc.
* A cloud can only have one current _active_ `assignment` associated with it.
* QUADS moves sets of hosts into or out of clouds depending on their schedule by modifying their VLAN memberships.

### What is an Assignment
* An `assignment` is any past, present or future workload running in an cloud.
* Each assignment has a unique id.
* There is no limit to the amount of past or future assignments a cloud can have but there can only be one _active_ assignment per cloud.

```sql
quads=# select * from assignments where id = 57;
 id | active | provisioned | validated |     description      |  owner   | ticket | qinq | wipe |
                   ccuser                                                                     | cloud_id | vlan_id |        created_at         | is
_self_schedule | ostype

               |
(1 row)
```

### What is a Schedule
* A `schedule` is host-level metadata for each QUADS-managed host that tells it what `cloud` it is part of, where it should move to or from if needed and when.
* A host schedule is referenced by a unique `schedule-id`.
* One to many hosts with the same schedule date(s) comprise a QUADS environment or workload in a cloud, referenced by an `assignment`.

```
# quads --ls-schedule --host e33-h03-000-r650.example.com
Default cloud: cloud01
Current cloud: cloud04
Current schedule: 3181
1844| start=2024-05-26T22:00, end=2024-11-10T22:00, cloud=cloud27
3181| start=2024-12-04T17:00, end=2025-05-04T22:00, cloud=cloud04
```

## Deployment Scale Limits

_How many hosts and environments can a single QUADS instance use?_

* Current and future limits per VLAN-tagged layer 2 Network
* Please see the [detailed scale limits](/docs/quads-scale-limits.md) documentation for more information.

| Component | Current Limit | Future RFE #589 Limit | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------------|-------|
| Cloud Environments | 399 | 1268 | assuming 4x interfaces max/host|
| Physical Hosts | 24,540 | 24,540 | assuming 4x interfaces max/host|

## QUADS Workflow

You can read about QUADS architecture, provisioning, visuals and workflow [in our documentation examples and screenshots](/docs/quads-workflow.md)

## QUADS Switch and Host Setup
   - To ensure you have setup your network switches and bare-metal hosts properly please follow our [Switch and Host Setup Docs](/docs/switch-host-setup.md)

## Installing QUADS
   - We support modern Fedora OS distributions using RPM packages.

### Installing QUADS from RPM
   - We build RPM packages for the Fedora distribution.
   - The following commands will install the QUADS package and all dependencies.

```bash
dnf copr enable quadsdev/python3-quads  -y
dnf install quads -y
```

   - Make sure the QUADS services are initialized via systemd:

```bash
systemctl start quads-{db,server,web}
```

   - Additionally, the `quads-db` needs to be initialized via the following command:

```bash
flask --app quads.server.app init-db
```

#### User Management

QUADS provides Flask CLI commands for managing user accounts:

**Add a new user:**
```bash
flask --app quads.server.app add-user --username user@example.com --password securepassword --role admin
flask --app quads.server.app add-user --username user@example.com --password securepassword --role user
```

Available roles:
- `admin` - Administrative privileges with full access
- `user` - Regular user with limited access

**Change a user's password:**
```bash
flask --app quads.server.app mod-user --username user@example.com --password newsecurepassword
```

**Change a user's role (promote to admin or demote to user):**
```bash
flask --app quads.server.app mod-user --username user@example.com --role admin
```

The `--role` option accepts `admin` or `user` and replaces the user's current role. It can be combined with `--password` in a single call.

**Delete a user:**
```bash
flask --app quads.server.app delete-user --username user@example.com
```

**Important Notes:**
- All user management operations use Flask-Security for proper password hashing and security
- Username changes are not supported - create a new user and delete the old one if needed
- User deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- These commands require database access and should be run from the QUADS server

   - Now you're ready to go and start configuring QUADS environments, hosts, and other components below.
   - You should be able to access `quads-web` here now: http://QUADSVM and your [QUADS API](docs/quads-api.md) will also be available.
   - Make sure you open up TCP/80 and/or TCP/443 on your host firewall of choice, to enable SSL/TLS follow the next optional section.

#### Using SSL with Flask API and QUADS

This step is optional but may be welcoming due to recent HSTS enforcement in most browsers.

To enable TLS/SSL on QUADS (API, Web) you'll need to generate your own certificates, **if you're cool with self-signed cerificates** you can use this one-liner below, otherwise you should adapt this to signed TLS/SSL certificates from your IT department.

```bash
servername=$(hostname)
mkdir -p /etc/pki/tls/certs ; cd /etc/pki/tls/certs
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout $servername.key -out $servername.pem -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -subj "/C=XX/ST=StateName/L=CityName/O=CompanyName/OU=CompanySectionName/CN=CommonNameOrHostname"
```

This generates your certificate and key here:

| SSL Component | File System Path                    |
| --------------|-------------------------------------|
| Nginx Cert    | /etc/pki/tls/certs/servername.pem   |
| Nginx Key     | /etc/pki/tls/certs/servername.key   |


Next you'll need to copy `apiv3_ssl.conf.example` into place as `apiv3_ssl.conf`

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/conf.d
cp apiv3_ssl.conf.example apiv3_ssl.conf
```

Lastly, in-line edit the configuration file to point to your generated cert/key pair.

```bash
servername=$(hostname) ; sed -i -e "s/quads.example.com/$servername/" /etc/nginx/conf.d/apiv3_ssl.conf
```

Lastly, restart nginx:

```bash
systemctl restart nginx
```

### QUADS Wiki
   - The Wiki component for QUADS is fully managed by `quads-web`

#### Dynamic Wiki Content
   - Additional content can be added dynamically to the wiki by adding content to the `/opt/quads/web` directory.
   - The way directory is to be structured is so that any directory is considered as a submenu of the `quads-web` navigation bar with the exception of `static` directories which are ignored by the navbar generation and which contain any static files for all the html files.
   - Additionally, the "friendly" text on the links will match that of the file without undescores.
   - Any files without extensions will be considered direct links with the content of it being only the hyperlink in plain text.
   - The html files should be structured for the correct jinja templating that is expected like this:

```jinja
    {% extends "base.html" %}
    {% block title %} INSERT TITLE HERE {% endblock %}

    {% block page_content %}
    INSERT HTML CONTENT HERE
    {% endblock %}
```

   - For static files such as images and css, all files go on the root `/static` directory and the src href has to be passed via `url_for` like this:

```html
        <img
          loading="lazy"
          decoding="async"
          class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5616"
          src="{{url_for('content.static', filename='scale_lab_assignments-march-may.png')}}"
          alt=""
          width="1030"
          height="542"
        />
```

##### Ordering Elements in the Dynamic Wiki Content
   - The type of content in the `/opt/quads/web` directory are either files or directories.
   - Flat files are either html files which follow the jinja templating, or direct links files which contain a link to an external resource.
   - Directories are translated into sub-menus and in turn can contain flat files as described above.
   - In order to control the ordering of various elements, they can be named with numeric prefixes.
   - Custom flat file elements are listed first, followed by sub-menu (Directory) elements.
   - Example of unnumbered content is as follows.  In this example, you will have a menu that contains `Chat`, `Contact`, `FAQ`, and `Usage`, followed by the Submenus `Docs`, `Resources` and `Tickets`

![Unordered Content](/image/Menus-Unnumbered.png)

   - If you wish to order them, rename your files and directories and add integer prefixes.  For example, the following will list the numbered elements followed by the un-numbered elements and would yield: `FAQ`, `Usage`, `Chat`, `Contact`, followed by the Submenus `Tickets`, `Resources` and `Docs` in that order.

### Installing other QUADS Components

#### QUADS Move Command
   - QUADS relies on the plugin architecture to provision and manage machines. The release workflow is handled by the `standard` release plugin (configured in `/opt/quads/conf/plugins.yml`), which coordinates the provisioner and hardware steps; switch VLAN configuration is applied by the move command. Read more about this in the [move-host-command](#quads-move-host-command) section below and the [Plugin Architecture Documentation](/docs/quads-plugins.md).

#### Google OAuth Setup
   - For optionally integrating QUADS with Google OAuth SSO you can follow the instructions on [Google OAuth Setup](/docs/google-oauth-setup.md) docs.

### Making QUADS Run
   - QUADS is a passive service and does not do anything you do not tell it to do.  We control QUADS with [cron commands](/cron/quads).
   - We ship an example cron file and install it for you that should work out of the box, it just has entries commented out.
   - To enable QUADS services to run you'll need to **uncomment them**.

```bash
crontab -e
```

#### Major Components

   - Below are the major components run out of cron that makes everything work.

| Service Command       | Category | Purpose |
|-----------------------|----------|---------|
| quads --move-hosts    | provisioning | checks for hosts to move/reclaim as scheduled (uses release plugins) |
| quads --validate-env  | validation | checks clouds pending to be released for all enabled validation checks (uses validator plugins) |
| quads --regen-heatmap | visualization | keeps your systems availability and usage visualization up to date |
| quads --regen-instack | openshift/openstack | keeps optional openstack triple-o installation files up-to-date |
| quads --notify        | notifications | check and send email or webhook/IRC notifications on events and releases (uses chat/email plugins) |

#### External Services

   - QUADS integrates with external services via the plugin architecture (configured in `/opt/quads/conf/plugins.yml`)
   - Core plugins include: Foreman (provisioning), JIRA (ticketing), Slack/Google Chat/IRC (notifications), Badfish (hardware management), Juniper switches (network automation)
   - See the [Plugin Architecture Documentation](/docs/quads-plugins.md) for configuration details

| Service Command       | Category | Purpose |
|-----------------------|----------|---------|
| quads --foreman-rbac  | RBAC | ensures environment user ownership maps to systems in Foreman |

#### Verifying Configuration
   - After editing your QUADS configuration files you can verify them with `--conf-check` before proceeding.
   - This checks all files in `/opt/quads/conf/` for YAML syntax errors, duplicate keys, and mandatory settings that are still set to their shipped defaults.

```bash
quads --conf-check
```

   - Settings that must be changed from their defaults include:

| File | Setting | Default Value |
|------|---------|---------------|
| quads.yml | domain | example.com |
| quads.yml | quads_url | https://quads.scalelab.example.com |
| plugins.yml | plugins.foreman.url | http://foreman.example.com/hosts/ |
| plugins.yml | plugins.foreman.api_url | https://foreman.example.com/api/v2 |
| plugins.yml | plugins.email.smtp_host | mail.example.com |
| oauth.yml | oauth_settings.allowed_domains | example.com |

   - The `oauth_settings.allowed_domains` check severity depends on `require_auth_provider` in `selfservice.yml`. When `require_auth_provider` is `false` this is a warning; when `true` it is an error.
   - Duplicate YAML keys are reported as warnings since `yaml.safe_load()` silently keeps only the last value, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
   - A clean configuration returns a health check summary; any findings are displayed in a table with severity levels.

## QUADS Usage Documentation

### Adding New Hosts to QUADS

#### Define Initial Cloud Environments
   - Define the various cloud environments
   - These are the isolated environments QUADS will use and provision into for you.
   - Note that **cloud01** is the designated "Spare Pool" where servers will go when they are first added and also when they have no active assignments to move to for a workload.  You can name it [anything you want](/conf/quads.yml#L7) by editing the QUADS configuration file `/opt/quads/conf/quads.yml`

```bash
quads --define-cloud --cloud cloud01
quads --define-cloud --cloud cloud02 --description "02 Cloud Environment"
quads --define-cloud --cloud cloud03 --description "03 Cloud Environment"
```

#### Define Host in QUADS and Foreman

##### Define your Server Models

* Look for the `models:` [key/value pair](/conf/quads.yml#L88) and add ones that accurately describe your fleet.
* This can be any identifiable string, we have added some stock ones we use for example but anything that makes sense to you to distinguish system models, sub-models etc that works for your needs e.g. R750-IL-XG might be a sub-model of a Dell R750.
* Models are used for filtering search, availability and other useful features and it's a mandatory data element you need to provide.


```bash
vi /opt/quads/conf/quads.yml
```

```bash
models: R620,R630,R640,R650,R930,R730XD,FC640
```

Now save this file and restart the QUADS server daemon.

```bash
systemctl restart quads-server
```

You will need to do this when you introduce new system models into your fleet if they are new.

##### Define your QUADS Hosts
> [!NOTE]
> Before proceeding here please read [adding new QUADS hosts](/docs/switch-host-setup.md#adding-new-quads-host) in the environment setup documentation as it covers physically adding your systems and DNS (or CNAME) entries for your host IPMI interfaces.
> Hosts should be defined and exist in Foreman first before adding them to QUADS.

> [!TIP]
> The ```--host-type``` parameter is a mandatory, free-form label that can be anything that makes sense to you for organization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `--bootmode` parameter is optional and must correspond to Bios, Uefi. If not set, it defaults to None.
>
> During the release workflow, the Badfish hardware plugin is used to check the current bootmode for a host and compared against the host bootmode setting.
>
> When a host's current bootmode does not match the defined bootmode for the host, badfish is used to ensure correct setting.
>
> It is recommended to set this parameter for managed hosts to avoid provisioning issues if tenants can change the value to one not compatible with your provisioning system.

> [!NOTE]
> You must include `--rack` and `--uloc` when defining hosts.
> If you don't use traditional datacenter server racks and u-locations just use some description that makes sense for you.
> The argument `--blade` is optional and only used for blade systems to identify a bladecenter member in a chassis.
> You **must define the model(s) of systems before you define them** in the previous step.

   - Define your QUADS hosts:

```bash
quads --define-host --host <hostname> --default-cloud cloud01 --host-type general --model R630 --rack f01 --uloc h01 --bootmode Bios
```

#### Define Host Interfaces in QUADS

   - Define the host interfaces, these are the internal interfaces you want QUADS to manage for VLAN automation
   - Do this for every interface you want QUADS to manage per host (we are working on auto-discovery of this step).
   - The variable `default_pxe_interface` in the `/opt/quads/conf/quads.yml` will set the default value of `pxe_boot=True` for that interface while any other interface will have a default value of `False` unless specified via `--pxe-boot` or `--no-pxe-boot`. This can be later modified via `--mod-interface`.

```bash
quads --add-interface --interface-name em1 --interface-mac 52:54:00:d9:5d:df --interface-switch-ip 10.12.22.201 --interface-port xe-0/0/1:0 --interface-vendor "Intel" --interface-speed 1000 --host <hostname>
quads --add-interface --interface-name em2 --interface-mac 52:54:00:d9:5d:dg --interface-switch-ip 10.12.22.201 --interface-port xe-0/0/1:1 --interface-vendor "Intel" --interface-speed 1000 --pxe-boot --host <hostname>
quads --add-interface --interface-name em3 --interface-mac 52:54:00:d9:5d:dh --interface-switch-ip 10.12.22.201 --interface-port xe-0/0/1:2 --interface-vendor "Intel" --interface-speed 1000 --host <hostname>
quads --add-interface --interface-name em4 --interface-mac 52:54:00:d9:5d:d1 --interface-switch-ip 10.12.22.201 --interface-port xe-0/0/1:3 --interface-vendor "Intel" --interface-speed 1000 --host <hostname>
```

   - To list the hosts:

```bash
quads --ls-hosts
```
You will now see the list of full hosts.

```bash
c08-h21-r630.example.com
c08-h22-r630.example.com
c08-h23-r630.example.com
c08-h24-r630.example.com
c08-h25-r630.example.com
c08-h26-r630.example.com
c08-h27-r630.example.com
c08-h28-r630.example.com
c08-h29-r630.example.com
c09-h01-r630.example.com
c09-h02-r630.example.com
c09-h03-r630.example.com
```

   - To list a hosts interface and switch information:

```bash
quads --ls-interface --host c08-h21-r630.example.com

{"name": "em1", "mac_address": "52:54:00:d9:5d:df", "switch_ip": "10.12.22.201", "switch_port": "xe-0/0/1:0"}
{"name": "em2", "mac_address": "52:54:00:d9:5d:dg", "switch_ip": "10.12.22.201", "switch_port": "xe-0/0/1:1"}
{"name": "em3", "mac_address": "52:54:00:d9:5d:dh", "switch_ip": "10.12.22.201", "switch_port": "xe-0/0/1:2"}
{"name": "em4", "mac_address": "52:54:00:d9:5d:d1", "switch_ip": "10.12.22.201", "switch_port": "xe-0/0/1:3"}
```

   - To see the current system allocations:

```bash
quads --summary
```
```
cloud01 : 45 (Primary Cloud Environment)
cloud02 : 22 (02 Cloud Environment)
```
   - For a more detailed summary of current system allocations use `--detail`

```bash
quads --summary --detail
```
```
cloud01 (quads): 45 (Primary Cloud Environment) - 451
cloud02 (jdoe): 22 (02 Cloud Environment) - 462
```
   - For including clouds with no active assignments use `--all`

```bash
quads --summary --detail --all
```
```
cloud01 (quads): 45 (Primary Cloud Environment) - 451
cloud02 (jdoe): 22 (02 Cloud Environment) - 462
cloud03 (jhoffa): 0 (03 Cloud Environment) - 367
```
**NOTE:**

The format here is based on the following:
`{cloud_name} ({owner}): {count} ({description}) - {ticket_number}`

   - Define a custom schedule for a host
     - Example: assign host ```c08-h21``` to the workload/cloud ```cloud02```

```bash
quads --add-schedule --host c08-h21-r630.example.com --schedule-start "2016-07-11 08:00" --schedule-end "2016-07-12 08:00" --schedule-cloud cloud02
```

   - List the schedule for a specific host:

```bash
quads --ls-schedule --host c08-h21-r630.example.com
```

You'll see the schedule output below

```
Default cloud: cloud01
Current cloud: cloud02
Defined schedules:
  0:
    start: 2016-07-11 08:00
    end: 2016-07-12 08:00
    cloud: cloud02
```

   - Move any hosts that need to be re-allocated based on the current schedule

```bash
quads --move-hosts
```

You should see the following verbosity from a move operation

```
INFO: Moving c08-h21-r630.example.com from cloud01 to cloud02 c08-h21-r630.example.com cloud01 cloud02
```

### How Provisioning Works
#### QUADS Move Host Command
In QUADS, the move workflow is the actionable process that provisions and moves a set of systems from one cloud environment to the other. Via cron, QUADS routinely queries the existing schedules and when it comes time for a set of systems to move to a new environment, or to be reclaimed and moved back to the spare pool, it runs the move workflow for each host.

The move workflow is handled by the `standard` release plugin, which coordinates the provisioner (Foreman), hardware (Badfish) and switch (Juniper) plugins for each host.

* Runs against all hosts according to the QUADS schedule.

```bash
quads --move-hosts
```
* The move workflow uses the plugin architecture (release, provisioner, hardware, and switch plugins)
* Plugins are configured in `/opt/quads/conf/plugins.yml`

##### Query a Host Cloud Membership
* You can use `quads --ls-host-cloud --host hostname` to show it's current cloud environment membership.

```bash
quads --ls-host-cloud --host host01.example.com

cloud19
```

##### QUADS Move Host Command Dry Run
* You can use the `quads --move-hosts --dry-run` command to report what QUADS would do but only report it with no action.
* You can also use the `--date` flag to see what actions might take place at a certain future time e.g.:
```
quads --move-hosts --dry-run --date "2024-12-24 22:00"

Moving d16-h01-000-r650.example.com from cloud37 to cloud01, wipe = False
Moving d16-h06-000-r650.example.com from cloud60 to cloud01, wipe = False
Moving d16-h07-000-r650.example.com cloud60 to cloud01, wipe = False

```

##### Monitoring Move Progress
* Use `--show-progress` to monitor active moves through their 12-stage provisioning pipeline:

```
quads --show-progress --all
quads --show-progress --cloud cloud02
```

> [!TIP]
> Combine with `watch` for a live dashboard: `watch -n 10 quads --show-progress --all`
>
> The same data is available via the [REST API](/docs/quads-api.md#query-move-progress) at `GET /api/v3/moves/progress/`

* The move workflow is now managed through the plugin architecture
* To customize the release workflow:
  - Create a custom release plugin implementing the `ReleasePlugin` interface
  - Release is a single-plugin category: disable `standard` and enable exactly one replacement in `/opt/quads/conf/plugins.yml`
  - See the [Custom Release Plugin example](/docs/quads-plugins.md#example-custom-release-plugin) and [Dispatcher Model](/docs/quads-plugins.md#dispatcher-model) in the Plugin Architecture Documentation
* The standard release plugin coordinates:
  - **Provisioner plugins** (e.g., Foreman) for OS deployment
  - **Hardware plugins** (e.g., Badfish) for power/boot management
* Switch VLAN configuration and pre-release validation run as separate steps in the move workflow, not within the release plugin

## QUADS Reporting

### Future Assignment Reporting

As of QUADS `1.1.6` we now have the `--report-detailed` command which will list all upcoming future assignments that are scheduled.
You can also specify custom start and end dates via `--schedule-start "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"` and `--schedule-end "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"`

```bash
quads --report-detailed
```
Example Output
```
Owner    |    Ticket|    Cloud| Description| Systems|  Scheduled| Duration|
tcruise  |      1034|  cloud20|   Openshift|       6| 2022-02-06|       14|
cwalken  |      1031|  cloud19|   Openstack|       6| 2022-02-06|       14|
bhicks   |      1029|  cloud18| Openstack-B|       4| 2022-02-06|       14|
nreeves  |      1028|  cloud11| Openshift-P|       2| 2022-02-06|       14|
gcarlin  |      1026|  cloud08|        Ceph|       4| 2022-02-06|       14|
```

### Server Availability Overview Report

Generate a report with a list of server types with total count of systems and their current and future availability plus an average build time delta overall

```bash
quads --report-available
```
Example output
```
Quads report for 2019-12-01 to 2019-12-31:
Percentage Utilized: 60%
Average build delta: 0:00:26.703556
Server Type | Total|  Free| Scheduled| 2 weeks| 4 weeks
r620        |     5|     0|      100%|       0|       0
1029p       |     3|     3|        0%|       3|       3
```

Additionally, you can pass `--schedule-start` and `--schedule-end` dates for reports in the past. 2 weeks and 4 weeks free calculate starting days from the first Sunday following when the command was run, or return current day at 22:01 if run on Sunday.

### Assignment Scheduling Statistics

Generate a report detailing systems and scheduling utilization over the course of months or years.

```bash
quads --report-scheduled --months 6
```
Example Output
```
Month   | Scheduled|  Systems|  % Utilized|
2022-02 |         1|     1268|         42%|
2022-01 |         9|     1268|         66%|
2022-02 |         1|     1268|         42%|
2021-09 |        10|     1226|         83%|
2021-08 |        14|     1215|         77%|
2021-07 |         3|     1215|         87%|
```

### Upcoming Scheduled Assignments Report

Generate statistics on the number of assigned clouds in quads over a period of months in the past starting today or on a specific year.

```bash
quads --report-scheduled --months 6
```
Example output
```
Month   | Scheduled|  Systems|  % Utilized|
2019-12 |         0|        8|         58%|
2019-11 |         2|        8|         62%|
2019-10 |        15|        8|         20%|
2019-09 |         0|        0|          0%|
2019-08 |         0|        0|          0%|

```

Additionally, you can pass `--year` instead for a report for every month in that year.

### Self-Scheduled Assignments Report

Generate a report of all self-scheduled (SSM) assignments within a given time range. By default this reports on the current month.

```bash
quads --report-self-scheduled
```
Example Output
```
# | Cloud Owner | Cloud Ticket | Cloud Name | Description    | System Count | Date Requested
1 | jsmith      | SSM-4521     | cloud12    | OCP testing    |            5 | 2026-07-01
2 | cwalken     | SSM-4530     | cloud14    | Network lab    |            3 | 2026-07-03
```

You can filter by `--days`, `--weeks` or `--months` to adjust the reporting window.

```bash
quads --report-self-scheduled --days 7
quads --report-self-scheduled --weeks 2
quads --report-self-scheduled --months 3
```

### Exporting Reports

All report commands support `--export` to save report output as markdown, HTML or JSON. Exported files are written to `/tmp/` with a timestamped filename.

```bash
quads --report-self-scheduled --export json
quads --report-available --export markdown
quads --report-scheduled --months 6 --export html
quads --report-detailed --export json
```

The `--export` flag can be combined with any time range arguments supported by the report.

## Customizing Environment Web Details
### Changing the Default Lab Name
You can change the default QUADS environment name by modifying the `lab_name` variable in the [quadsweb.yml](/conf/quadsweb.yml#L15)

Restart `quads-web` to take effect.

```bash
systemctl restart quads-web
```

## Common Administration Tasks

### Creating a New Cloud Assignment and Schedule

Creating a new schedule and assigning machines is currently done through the QUADS CLI.  There are a few options you'll want to utilize.  Mandatory options are in bold and optional are in italics.

   -  **description** (this will appear on the assignments dynamic wiki)
   -  **cloud-owner** (for associating ownership and usage notifications)
   -  *force* (needed for re-using an existing cloud)
   -  *cc-users* (Add additional people to notifications, comma-separated)
   -  *cloud-ticket* (RT ticket used for the work, also appears in the assignments dynamic wiki)
   -  *wipe* (whether to reprovision machines going into this cloud, default is 1 or wipe.

#### QUADS VLAN Options

This pertains to the internal interfaces that QUADS will manage for you to move sets of hosts between environments based on a schedule.  For setting up optional publicly routable VLANS please see the [QUADS public vlan setup steps](/docs/switch-host-setup.md#define-optional-public-vlans)

   -  VLAN design (optional, will default to `qinq: 0` below)

   - ```qinq: 0``` (default) qinq VLAN separation by interface: primary, secondary and beyond QUADS-managed interfaces all match the same VLAN membership across other hosts in the same cloud allocation.  Each interface per host is in its own VLAN, and these match across the rest of your allocated hosts by interface (all nic1, all nic2, all nic3, all nic4 etc).

   - ```qinq: 1``` all QUADS-managed interfaces in the same qinq VLAN. For this to take effect you need to pass the optional argument of `--qinq 1` to the `--define-cloud` command.

   - You can use the command `quads --ls-qinq` to view your current assignment VLAN configuration:

```bash
quads --ls-qinq
```
```
cloud01: 0 (Isolated)
cloud02: 1 (Combined)
cloud03: 0 (Isolated)
cloud04: 1 (Combined)
```

#### Optional QUADS Public VLAN

If you need to associate a public vlan (routable) with your cloud, quads currently supports associating your last NIC per host with one of your defined public VLANs (see the [QUADS public vlan setup steps](/docs/switch-host-setup.md#define-optional-public-vlans)).

To define your cloud with a public VLAN, use the following syntax:

```bash
quads --define-cloud --cloud cloud03 [ other define-cloud options ] --vlan 601
```

If you need to clear the vlan association with your cloud, you can pass any string to the `--vlan` argument in `--mod-cloud`

```bash
quads --mod-cloud --cloud cloud03 --vlan none
```

#### Optional Cloud Boot Order

QUADS supports two pre-defined BIOS boot orders for supported Dell systems based on [badfish](https://github.com/quadsproject/badfish) [BIOS boot orders](https://github.com/quadsproject/badfish?tab=readme-ov-file#idrac-and-data-format).  You define and manage this in your [idrac_interfaces.yml](conf/idrac_interfaces.yml).

```
quads --define-cloud --cloud cloud03 --boot-order foreman
```

You can change this at any time via `--mod-cloud`

```
quads --mod-cloud --cloud cloud03 --boot-order director
```

> [!TIP]
> You can leverage `idrac_interfaces.yml` to define any BIOS boot order for systems you like as reported via `badfish --check-boot` and leverage either the `foreman` or `director` labels to enforce this based on key/value pairs.

#### Defining a New Cloud

```bash
quads --define-cloud --cloud cloud03 --description "Messaging AMQ" --cloud-owner epresley --cc-users "jdoe, jhoffa" --cloud-ticket 423625 --qinq 1
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can change any of these values selectively via the `--mod-cloud` command [described below](#modifying-cloud-level-attributes).

   - Now that you've defined your new cloud you'll want to allocate machines and a schedule.
   - We're going to find the first 20 Dell r620's and assign them as an example.

#### Adding New Hosts to your Cloud
```bash
quads --ls-available --filter "model==R620" | head -20 > /tmp/RT423624
```
   - Now we'll allocate all of these hosts with a schedule, by default our system times use UTC.

```bash
quads --host-list /tmp/RT423624 --add-schedule --schedule-start "2016-10-17 00:00" --schedule-end "2016-11-14 17:00" --schedule-cloud cloud03
```

#### Adding New Hosts to your Cloud with JIRA Integration

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using [JIRA integration features](/docs/using-jira-with-quads.md) you can utilize `--host-list` along with a list of hosts and it will take care of updating your `--cloud-ticket` in JIRA for you in one swoop.

```bash
quads --add-schedule --host-list /tmp/hosts --schedule-start "2021-04-20 22:00" --schedule-end "2021-05-02 22:00" --schedule-cloud cloud20
```

That's it.  At this point your hosts will be queued for provision and move operations, we check once a minute if there are any pending provisioning tasks.  To check manually:

```bash
quads --move-hosts --dry-run

```

After your hosts are provisioned and moved you should see them populate under the cloud list.

```bash
quads --cloud-only --cloud cloud03
```

### Managing Notifications
QUADS notifications come in three forms:  Webhook/IRC, Jira and email, please see the below table.
The notification delivery plugins (email, chat) are configured in [plugins.yml](conf/plugins.yml) while notification content settings such as `quads_notify_until_extended`, `quads_request_url` and the JIRA docs links live in the QUADS [configuration file](conf/quads.yml).

| Event | Type | Delivery | Database Name | Template Name |
|-------|------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| New environment defined | scheduling | email | pre_initial | [future_initial_message](src/quads/templates/future_initial_message) |
| New environment allocated | scheduling | email | initial | [initial_message](src/quads/templates/initial_message) |
| New environment allocated | scheduling | webhook/IRC | initial | [called in notify](/src/quads/tools/notify.py#L75) |
| New assignment scheduled | scheduling | Jira | N/A | [jira_ticket_assignment](src/quads/templates/jira_ticket_assignment) |
| Change in environment | assignment | email | pre | [future_message](src/quads/templates/future_message) |
| Environment expiring | assignment | email | one_day, three_days, five_days, seven_days | [message](src/quads/templates/message) |
| Validation failed (admin) | validation | email | fail | [validation_failed](src/quads/templates/validation_failed) |
| Validation success (admin) | validation | email | success | [validation_succeeded](src/quads/templates/validation_succeeded) |
| Add to watchers failed | ticketing | Jira | N/A | [watchers_fail](src/quads/templates/watchers_fail) |

#### Listing Notifications
You can use the `quads --ls-notifications` command to list all notification status states if they are managed in the database.

* Note: You can also use the [tenant notification tool](#tenant-notifications-via-email-or-ticketing-system) to send ad-hoc notifications to email or via Jira updates by environment, rack or all active tenants for ad-hoc contact.

```
# quads --ls-notifications
cloud    ticket  fail   success  initial  pre_initial  pre    one_day  three_days  five_days  seven_days
========================================================================================================
cloud02  3930    False  True     True     True         False  False    False       False      False
cloud03  3931    False  False    True     True         True   False    False       False      False
```

#### Modifying Notifications
You can use the `quads --mod-notification` command to reset notification values, valid arguments are the database names of the notification values e.g. `--one-day` and the environment with `--cloud`

```bash
# quads --mod-notification --cloud cloud02 --initial false
```

### Managing Faulty Hosts
Starting with `1.1.4` QUADS can manage broken or faulty hosts for you and ensure they are ommitted from being added to a future schedule or listed as available.  Prior to `1.1.4` this is managed via the Foreman host parameter `broken_state` (true/false).

* Listing all broken systems.
```bash
# quads --ls-broken
f18-h22-000-r620.stage.example.com
```

* Marking a system as faulty
```bash
# quads --mark-broken --host f18-h23-000-r620.example.com
Host f18-h23-000-r620.example.com is now marked as broken
```

* Marking a system as repaired or no longer faulty.
```bash
# quads --mark-repaired --host f18-h23-000-r620.example.com
Host f18-h23-000-r620.example.com is now marked as repaired.
```

* Hosts marked as faulty will be ommitted from `--ls-available`
* Hosts marked as faulty are not able to be scheduled until they are marked as repaired again.

### Managing Retired Hosts

* The quads commmands `--retire`, `--unretire` and `--ls-retired` features to manage decomissioning or reviving hosts.
* Hosts marked as retired will still retain their scheduling history and data, but will not show as available unless filtered.
   - To list retired hosts:

```bash
quads --ls-retired
```
* To retire a host:
```bash
quads --retire --host host01.example.com
```
* To unretire a host:
```bash
quads --unretire --host host01.example.com
```

#### Retiring Hosts
* Before retiring a host you should move it back to your resource pool first, in our case this is `cloud01`.
* This requires shrinking any active schedules on the host.
* The below command will shrink any active schedules on those hosts without prompting to terminate immediately.

```bash
for host in $(cat /tmp/retired_hosts); do yes | quads --shrink --host $host --now; done
```

* After this the next `quads --move-hosts` run will move these back to your resource pool and power them off.
* `retired` hosts will remain officially in your resource pool but not show up in any visualizations or usage reporting, however their past usage history will all be available for record keeping and data requirements.

### Extending the Schedule of an Existing Cloud

Occasionally you'll want to extend the lifetime of a particular assignment. QUADS lets you do this with one command but you'll want to double-check things first.
In this example we'll be extending the assignment end date for cloud02

```bash
quads --extend --cloud cloud02 --weeks 2 --check
```

This will check whether or not the environment can be extended without conflicts.

To go ahead and extend it remove the `--check`

```bash
quads --extend --cloud cloud02 --weeks 2
```

### Extending the Schedule of a Specific Host

You might also want to extend the lifetime of a specific host.
In this example we'll be extending the assignment end date for host01.

```bash
quads --extend --host host01 --weeks 2 --check
```

This will check whether or not the environment can be extended without conflicts.

To go ahead and extend it remove the `--check`

```bash
quads --extend --host host01 --weeks 2
```

### Shrinking the Schedule of an Existing Cloud

Occasionally you'll want to shrink the lifetime of a particular assignment.
In this example we'll be shrinking the assignment end date for cloud02

```bash
quads --shrink --cloud cloud02 --weeks 2 --check
```

This will check whether or not the environment can be shrunk without conflicts.

To go ahead and shrink it remove the `--check`

```bash
quads --shrink --cloud cloud02 --weeks 2
```

### Shrinking the Schedule of a Specific Host

You might also want to shrink the lifetime of a specific host.
In this example we'll be shrinking the assignment end date for host01.

```bash
quads --shrink --host host01 --weeks 2 --check
```

This will check whether or not the host schedule can be shrunk without conflicts.

To go ahead and shrink it remove the `--check`

```bash
quads --shrink --host host01 --weeks 2
```

### Terminating a Schedule

If you would like to terminate the lifetime of a schedule at either a host or cloud level, you can pass the `--now` argument instead of `--weeks` which will set the schedules end date to now.
In this example we'll be terminating the assignment end date for cloud02.

```bash
quads --shrink --cloud cloud02 --now --check
```

This will check whether or not the environment can be terminated without conflicts.

To go ahead and terminate it remove the `--check`

```bash
quads --shrink --cloud cloud02 --now
```

### Adding Hosts to an existing Cloud

QUADS also supports adding new machines into an existing workload (cloud).

   - Search Availability Pool for Free Servers
      - Let's look for any 5 x servers from `2019-03-11 22:00` until `2019-04-22 22:00`

```bash
quads --ls-available --schedule-start "2016-12-05 08:00" --schedule-end "2016-12-15 08:00"

```
```
c03-h11-r620.rdu.openstack.example.com
c03-h13-r620.rdu.openstack.example.com
c03-h14-r620.rdu.openstack.example.com
c03-h15-r620.rdu.openstack.example.com
```

  - Move New Hosts into Existing Cloud

Above we see all the free servers during our timeframe, let's move them into cloud10

```bash
quads --host c03-h11-r620.rdu.openstack.example.com --add-schedule --schedule-start "2016-12-05 08:00" --schedule-end "2016-12-15 08:00" --schedule-cloud cloud10
quads --host c03-h13-r620.rdu.openstack.example.com --add-schedule --schedule-start "2016-12-05 08:00" --schedule-end "2016-12-15 08:00" --schedule-cloud cloud10
quads --host c03-h14-r620.rdu.openstack.example.com --add-schedule --schedule-start "2016-12-05 08:00" --schedule-end "2016-12-15 08:00" --schedule-cloud cloud10
quads --host c03-h15-r620.rdu.openstack.example.com --add-schedule --schedule-start "2016-12-05 08:00" --schedule-end "2016-12-15 08:00" --schedule-cloud cloud10
```

### Removing a Schedule

You can remove an existing schedule across a set of hosts using the ```--rm-schedule``` flag against the schedule ID for each particular machine of that assignment.

   - Example: removing the schedule for three machines in cloud
   - Obtain the schedule ID via ```quads --ls-schedule --host```
```bash
quads --rm-schedule --schedule-id 2
quads --rm-schedule --schedule-id 3
quads --rm-schedule --schedule-id 4
```

 * NOTE: Previous versions of QUADS required passing `--host`. This is not required on QUADS 2.0 onwards as the schedule Ids are now unique.

### Removing a Schedule across a large set of hosts

You should search for either the start or end dates to select the right schedule ID to remove when performing schedule removals across a large set of hosts.

   - If you are using QUADS in any serious capacity **always pick this option**.
   - Example: removing schedule by searching for start date.
   - Often machine schedule ID's are different for the same schedule across a set of machines, this ensures you remove the right one.

```bash
for host in $(cat /tmp/452851); do quads --rm-schedule --schedule-id $(quads --ls-schedule --host $host | grep cloud08 | grep "start=2017-08-06" | tail -1 | awk -F\| '{ print $1 }'); echo Done. ; done
```

### Removing a Host from QUADS

To remove a host entirely from QUADS management you can use the `--rm-host` command.

```bash
quads --rm-host --host f03-h30-000-r720xd.rdu2.example.com
Removed: {'host': 'f03-h30-000-r720xd.rdu2.example.com'}
```

### Modifying a Host Schedule

* Host schedules are managed by unique schedule ID's which can be viewed via the `--ls-schedule` command.
* To modify a host schedule use the `--mod-schedule --schedule-id` command and either `--schedule-start` or `--schedule-end` or both as needed.
* Before using this, make sure it's not easier to simply use `--shrink` or `--extend` and sub-commands across the entire cloud/environments or even per-host first.

```bash
quads --mod-schedule --host host01.example.com --schedule-id 31 --schedule-start "2023-05-22 22:00" --schedule-end "2023-06-22 22:00"
```

#### Modifying a Host Schedule across a large set of hosts

* You may often need to modify the same schedule ID across a large set of hosts, in this scenario you can use the following one-liner:
* You will want to filter for the specific cloudname and at least one schedule start or stop identifier (since environments are re-used).
  * In this example we use `cloud06` and `start=2023-03-13` to make sure our `--mod-schedule` command is unique.
* It's also a good idea to do this first by prepending `echo` to `quads` to ensure that the `schedule-id` are matched.

```bash
for host in $(cat /tmp/2491); do quads --mod-schedule --schedule-id $(quads --ls-schedule --host $host | grep cloud06 | grep "start=2023-03-13" | tail -1 | awk -F\| '{ print $1 }') --host $host --schedule-start "2023-03-12 22:00" ; done
```

### Modify Host Bootmode

* This parameter defines the value which bootmode should default to during move and rebuild.
* If not set when a [host is defined](#define-your-quads-hosts) it defaults to None. It can be modified later with the following commands:
* If you want to enforce Bios bootmode for a host:
```bash
quads --mod-host --host <hostname> --bootmode Bios
```
* If you want to enforce UEFI bootmode for a host:
```bash
quads --mod-host --host <hostname> --bootmode Uefi
```
* If you want to skip bootmode checks for a host:
```bash
quads --mod-host --host <hostname> --bootmode None
```

### Modify a Host Interface

You can change any of the properties of an interface (except its name) using --mod-interface:

```bash
quads --mod-interface --interface-name em1 --host f03-h30-000-r720xd.rdu2.example.com --interface-speed 1000
Interface successfully updated
```

### Remove a Host Interface

To remove a host interface entirely from QUADS management you can use the `--rm-interface` command.

```bash
quads --rm-interface --interface-name em1 --host f03-h30-000-r720xd.rdu2.example.com
Resource properly removed
```

### QUADS Provided Metadata

When a new cloud assignment is validated and released, QUADS automatically generates a `/root/quads_env.yml` metadata file on the first host of the allocation. This file provides the cloud owner with various metadata and environmment variables to assist with their automation.  Combining this with information from the QUADS API can empower tenants with a full range of post-release automation capabilities. 

The file is delivered once during the initial release notification via the built-in `clouddata` dayzero plugin and contains the following structure:

```yaml
cloud_name: cloud02
assignment_id: 42
bmc_user: quads
bmc_pass: rdu2@SCALELAB-12345
cloud_systems:
  - host01.example.com
  - host02.example.com
  - host03.example.com
cloud_ticket: https://issues.example.com/browse/SCALELAB-12345
foreman_api_url: https://foreman.example.com/api/v2
foreman_username: cloud02
foreman_password: rdu2@SCALELAB-12345
foreman_supported_os:
  - "RHEL 9.4"
  - "RHEL 10.0"
```

| Field | Source | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `cloud_name` | Assignment | Name of the allocated cloud environment |
| `assignment_id` | Assignment | Internal QUADS assignment identifier |
| `bmc_user` | `quads.yml` | IPMI/BMC username for out-of-band management |
| `bmc_pass` | Computed | BMC password (`{infra_location}@{ticket}`) |
| `cloud_systems` | Schedules | Sorted list of all host FQDNs in the allocation |
| `cloud_ticket` | Assignment | Full URL to the associated JIRA ticket |
| `foreman_api_url` | `plugins.yml` | Foreman API endpoint for host provisioning |
| `foreman_username` | Assignment | Per-cloud Foreman RBAC username (matches cloud name) |
| `foreman_password` | Computed | Foreman RBAC password (matches BMC password) |
| `foreman_supported_os` | Foreman API | List of available operating systems for reprovisioning |

To enable this plugin, add the following to `/opt/quads/conf/plugins.yml`:

```yaml
  clouddata:
    enabled: true
```

## Using the QUADS JSON API
* All QUADS actions under the covers uses the [JSON API v3](/docs/quads-api.md)

## API Tokens

QUADS supports named API tokens for programmatic access to the REST API. Tokens are long-lived credentials that replace the need to store passwords for API authentication. Each token is prefixed with `qat_` for easy identification.

### Creating API Tokens via the Web UI

1. Log in to the QUADS web interface via SSO
2. Click your username in the top-right corner and select **Profile**
3. Under **API Tokens**, enter a descriptive name (e.g. `CI pipeline`, `laptop`) and click **Generate Token**
4. Copy the token immediately -- it will only be displayed once and cannot be retrieved later
5. The token table shows all your tokens with their name, prefix, creation date, and last used timestamp

To revoke a token, click the **Revoke** button next to it. Revoked tokens stop working immediately.

### Using API Tokens

Use API tokens as Bearer tokens in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer qat_your_token_here" \
     https://quads.example.com/api/v3/hosts/
```

API tokens have the same permissions as the user who created them and work with all QUADS API endpoints that accept Bearer authentication.

### Managing API Tokens via the API

Tokens can also be managed programmatically through the REST API.

**List tokens:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer qat_your_token" \
     https://quads.example.com/api/v3/tokens/user@example.com/
```

**Create a token:**
```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer qat_your_token" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "new-token"}' \
     https://quads.example.com/api/v3/tokens/user@example.com/
```

The response includes a `token` field with the raw token value (returned only once).

**Revoke a token:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer qat_your_token" \
     https://quads.example.com/api/v3/tokens/user@example.com/42
```

> [!NOTE]
> Admin users can manage tokens for any user by specifying their email. Regular users can only manage their own tokens.

## QUADS Plugin Architecture
* QUADS features a flexible, extensible plugin system for integrating with external services and extending functionality
* Plugins are configured via `/opt/quads/conf/plugins.yml` and automatically discovered at startup
* **Plugin Types Available:**
  - **Chat** - Slack, Google Chat, IRC notifications
  - **Email** - SMTP email notifications
  - **Hardware** - Badfish IPMI/Redfish management
  - **Provisioners** - Foreman/Satellite integration
  - **Release** - Environment release workflows
  - **Switches** - Juniper network automation
  - **Ticketing** - JIRA integration
  - **Validators** - Environment health validation
* **Creating Custom Plugins:**
  - Implement the appropriate plugin interface
  - Place in `/opt/quads/plugins/` for automatic discovery
  - Configure in `plugins.yml` to enable
* See the comprehensive [Plugin Architecture Documentation](/docs/quads-plugins.md) for:
  - Configuration examples for all plugin types
  - How to create custom plugins
  - Plugin interfaces and APIs
  - Migration from legacy tools

### Custom Post Validation Plugins
dayzero plugins run after a cloud environment is validated and released. They are non-fatal by design, all exceptions are caught and logged to `/var/log/quads-dayzero.log`.

Each plugin's `execute(cloud)` method receives the cloud name and is responsible for looking up whatever host or schedule data it needs via the QUADS API.

User and lab-admin created plugins go in `/opt/quads/plugins/` under the appropriate category subdirectory. The directory structure mirrors the built-in plugin categories:

```
/opt/quads/plugins/
    chat/
    cloud/
    dayzero/
    email/
    hardware/
    provisioners/
    release/
    switches/
    ticketing/
    validators/
```

* Plugins placed here are auto-discovered at startup.
* The `/opt/quads/plugins/` tree is `%config(noreplace)` in the RPM, so your plugins will not be overwritten on upgrades.
* All plugins are enabled/disabled in `/opt/quads/conf/plugins.yml`.

### Writing Custom Plugins
To create your own dayzero plugin:

1. Create a Python file in `/opt/quads/plugins/dayzero/`
2. Inherit from `DayzeroPlugin` and implement `execute()`
3. Set `name` to match your filename (without `.py`)
4. Add a config entry in `plugins.yml` with `enabled: true`

```python
from quads.plugins.interfaces.dayzero import DayzeroPlugin


class MyPlugin(DayzeroPlugin):
    name = "myplugin"
    version = "1.0.0"
    description = "Example dayzero plugin"
    author = "Your Name"

    def initialize(self, plugin_manager=None):
        return True

    async def execute(self, cloud):
        self.logger.info(f"Cloud {cloud} released")
        return True
```

```yaml
# plugins.yml
  myplugin:
    enabled: true
```

This pattern works for any plugin category. For example, a custom chat plugin goes in `/opt/quads/plugins/chat/`, a custom validator in `/opt/quads/plugins/validators/`, etc.

## Self-Scheduling Hosts
* QUADS supports full-featured self service provisioning via the API documented [here](/docs/quads-self-schedule.md).
* You need to enable this on systems for them to be eligible for self-service scheduling via the API:

```bash
quads --mod-host --host f03-h30-000-r650.example.com --can-self-schedule true
```
* You can list all self-service capable systems with the `--filter` command:

```bash
quads --ls-hosts --filter "can_self_schedule==true"
```

## Filtering Systems by Hardware Capability
* We provide a flexible host hardware [metadata and filtering model](/docs/quads-host-metadata-search.md) via the API.

## Additional Tools and Commands

### Get host details
* Get details about a specific host
```bash
quads --host host01.example.com
```

### Get hosts in a cloud
* Get a list of all hosts currently in a cloud
```bash
quads --cloud cloud10
```

### Verify or Correct Cloud and Host Network Switch Settings
* `quads --verify-switch-conf` can be used to both validate and correct network switch configs.
* This can be run at a cloud environment level or per-host level.
* It's advised to run it first without `--change` to see if it would fix something.
* This will also check/correct optional routable VLANs if those are in use.
* To validate a clouds network config:

```bash
quads --verify-switch-conf --cloud cloud10
```

* To validate and fix a clouds network config use `--change`

```bash
quads --verify-switch-conf --cloud cloud10 --change
```

* To validate a singular hosts network switch configuration:
```
quads --verify-switch-conf --host host01.example.com
```

* To validate and fix a single hosts network config use `--change`

```
quads --verify-switch-conf --host host01.example.com --change
```

* To straddle clouds and place a single host into a cloud it does not belong in (rare use case):

```bash
quads --verify-switch-conf --host host01.example.com --cloud cloud10
```

Note, if host01.example.com is not in cloud10, but rather cloud20, you will see the following output:

```
WARNING - Both --cloud and --host have been specified.
WARNING -
WARNING - Host: host01.example.com
WARNING - Cloud: cloud10
WARNING -
WARNING - However, host01.example.com is a member of cloud20
WARNING -
WARNING - !!!!! Be certain this is what you want to do. !!!!!
WARNING -
```

### Modify or check a specific Host Network Switch Settings
* With the `quads --mod-switch-conf` tool you can set up each individual network interface to a specific vlan id.
* Passing the `--change` argument will make the changes effective in the switch. Not passing this will only verify the configuration is set to the desired.
* Interface arguments `--nic1` through `--nic20` are available and map to the host's interfaces in sorted order (e.g. `--nic1` corresponds to the first interface, `--nic2` to the second, etc).

```bash
quads --mod-switch-conf --host host01.example.com --nic1 1400 --nic2 1401 --nic3 1400 --nic4 1402 --nic5 1400
```
* All `--nic*` arguments are optional so this can be also done individually for all nics.

#### Mapping Interface to VLAN ID
* An easy way to figure out what VLAN corresponds to what generic `em` interface in the QUADS `--ls-interface` information we now include the following tool:
```bash
quads --ls-switch-conf --cloud cloud32
INFO - Cloud qinq: 1
INFO - Interface em1 appears to be a member of VLAN 1410
INFO - Interface em2 appears to be a member of VLAN 1410
```

This tool also accepts the `--all` argument which will list a detail for all hosts in the cloud.

Additional you can achieve the same with the following shell one-liner, setting `cloud=XX` for the cloud and adjusting `$(seq 1 4)` for your interface ranges available on the host.

```bash
cloud=32 ; origin=1100 ; offset=$(expr $(expr $cloud - 1) \* 10); vl=$(expr $origin + $offset) ;for i in $(seq 1 4) ; do vlan=$(expr $vl + $i - 1) ; echo "em$i is interface VLAN $vlan in cloud$cloud" ; done
```

```
em1 is interface VLAN 1400 in cloud32
em2 is interface VLAN 1401 in cloud32
em3 is interface VLAN 1402 in cloud32
em4 is interface VLAN 1403 in cloud32
```

* You can then use this information to map specific interfaces into other VLAN/clouds as required for more one-off or ad-hoc requirements beyond the standard VLAN modes that QUADS currently supports.
* **Note** that this would be an example for the default `Q-in-Q 0 (isolated)` VLAN configuration.  The `Q-in-Q 1 (combined)` configuration would simple be `VLAN1400` for all interfaces above respectively.


### Modifying Cloud-level Attributes
* You can redefine or change any aspects of an already-defined cloud starting in `1.1.4` with the `--mod-cloud` command.
* This can be done a per-parameter or combined basis:

```bash
quads --mod-cloud --cloud cloud02 --cloud-owner jhoffa
```

```bash
quads --mod-cloud --cloud cloud04 --cc-users "tpetty, fmercury"
```

```bash
quads --mod-cloud --cloud cloud06 --vlan 604 --wipe
```

```bash
quads --mod-cloud --cloud cloud50 --no-wipe
```

```bash
quads --mod-cloud --cloud cloud50 --vlan none
```

### Looking into the Future
* Because QUADS knows about all future schedules you can display what your environment will look like at any point in time using the `--date` command.

* Looking into a specific environment by date

```bash
quads --cloud-only --cloud cloud08 --date "2019-06-04 22:00"
```

```
f16-h01-000-1029u.rdu2.example.com
f16-h02-000-1029u.rdu2.example.com
f16-h03-000-1029u.rdu2.example.com
f16-h05-000-1029u.rdu2.example.com
f16-h06-000-1029u.rdu2.example.com
```

* Looking at all schedules by date

```bash
quads --ls-schedule --date "2020-06-04 22:00"
```

### Dry Run for Pending Actions
* You can see what's in progress or set to provision via the ```--dry-run``` sub-flag of ```--move-hosts```

```bash
quads --move-hosts --dry-run
```
```

### Find Free Cloud Environment

* You can use `quads --find-free-cloud` to suggest a cloud environment to use that does not have any future hosts scheduled to use it.

```bash
quads --find-free-cloud
```

```
cloud12
cloud16
cloud17
cloud18
```

### Find Available Hosts

* The `--ls-available` functionality lets you search for available hosts in the future based on a date range or other criteria.

  - Find based on a date range:

```bash
quads --ls-available --schedule-start "2019-12-05 08:00" --schedule-end "2019-12-15 08:00"
```

  - Find based on starting now with an end range:

```bash
quads --ls-available --schedule-end "2019-06-02 22:00"
```

#### Find Available Hosts based on Hardware or Model

* You can filter your availability search based on hardware capabilities or model type.
* Using this feature requires [importing hardware metadata](/docs/quads-host-metadata-search.md#how-to-import-host-metadata)
* Example below using `--filter "model==1029U-TRTP"`

```bash
quads --ls-available --schedule-start "2020-08-02 22:00" --schedule-end "2020-08-16 22:00" --filter "model==1029U-TRTP"
```

* Listing retired hosts can now use the `--filter` feature:

```bash
quads --ls-hosts --filter "retired==True"
```

* Listing specific hosts from a certain cloud:

```bash
quads --cloud-only --cloud cloud13 --filter "model==FC640"
```

#### Find Available Web Interface

* We have a Flask-based `--ls-available` web interface available on `quadshost`.
* This is provided via `quads-web`.
* You will need to seed the `models` data for your systems using the new [host metadata feature](/docs/quads-host-metadata-search.md)

![quads-available-web](/image/quads-available-web.png)

* Control + click can select more than one model
* Not selecting a model assumes a search for anything available.

#### Find a System by MAC Address
* You can utilize the metadata model and `--filter` command with `--ls-hosts` to search for a system by MAC Address.

```bash
quads --ls-hosts --filter "interfaces.mac_address==ac:1f:6b:2d:19:48"
```

#### Find Systems by Switch IP Address
* You can list what systems are connected to a switch by querying the `ip_address` (soon to be `switch_ip` in 1.1.7) information from the interfaces datasource.

```bash
quads --ls-hosts --filter "interfaces.ip_address==10.1.34.210"
```

### Tenant Notifications via Email or Ticketing system

* With the `notify_tenant.py` tenants can be easily emailed with important messages regarding their environment.
* Common use cases are to inform users of outages that may impact them.  The `notify_tenant.py` can be called with various options.
* The contents of the messages sent should be crafted in a temporary file (which is a simple jinja template that interprets 3 possible variables).

  - description (taken from allocation object)
  - cloud_name (taken from the cloud name)
  - ticket (taken from allocation object)

* For example, you can use a message template file (e.g. stored in `/tmp/message`) such as:

```
Regarding your allocation

Description: {{description}}
Allocation: {{cloud_name}}
Ticket: {{ticket}}

We are informing you of an upcoming outage, etc.
```

* Rack based notifications
```bash
python3 $PYTHONDIR/site-packages/quads/tools/notify_tenant.py --message /tmp/message --subject "Upcoming outage notification" --rack "f18 e22" --email --post
```
  - To ensure email is sent, use the `--email` flag.
  - To ensure message is posted to your ticketing system, use the `--post` flag.
  - Omitting both `--email` and `--post` means no notification will get sent or posted.

* Cloud based notifications
```bash
python3 $PYTHONDIR/site-packages/quads/tools/notify_tenant.py --message /tmp/message --subject "Upcoming outage notification" --cloud "cloudXX cloudYY" --email --post
```
  - The above will use the template message in `/tmp/message` and send it to the owners and cc-users of cloudXX and cloudYY.
  - The message will also be posted to your ticketing system.

* Notifications to all users.
```bash
python3 $PYTHONDIR/site-packages/quads/tools/notify_tenant.py --message /tmp/message --subject "Upcoming outage notification" --all --email --post
```
  - The above sends notifications to all active environments using your template message file in `/tmp/message`

### List Available Foreman OS Types

* The `--os-list` functionality lets you search for available operating systems provided by your Foreman.

```bash
quads --os-list
```

```bash
Id  Title      Release Name  Family
===================================
2   RHEL 8.6                 Redhat
3   RHEL 9.4                 Redhat
4   RHEL 9.5                 Redhat
```

### Managing Upgrades when Database Migrations are Required

* For more information see [QUADS Schema Change](/docs/quads-schema-change.md)

## Using JIRA with QUADS
* We utilize the JIRA ticketing system internally for R&D infrastructure requests managed by QUADS.
* We do provide some best-effort tooling and a JIRA library to bridge automation gaps.

   - For more information see [Using JIRA with QUADS](/docs/using-jira-with-quads.md)

## Backing up QUADS

* We do not implement backups for QUADS for you, but it's really easy to do on your own via Postgres [pg_dumpall](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pg-dumpall.html)
```
su - postgres -c "pg_dumpall --clean > /tmp/quadsdb.sql"
```

* Configuration files are all kept in `/opt/quads/conf`


## Restoring QUADS from Backup
* You can restore a QUADS databasea via Postgres [psql](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-administration/postgresql-restore-database/) and everything is in the database and `/opt/quads/conf` files.
* Restoring just the quads database:

```
su - postgres -c "psql -d quads -f /tmp/quadsdb.sql"
```

* Restoring the entire database:

```
su - postgres -c "psql -f /tmp/quadsdb.sql"
```

## Troubleshooting Validation Failures
A useful part of QUADS is the functionality for automated systems/network validation.  Below you'll find some steps to help understand why systems/networks might not pass validation so you can address any issues.

### Understanding Validation Structure
There are two main validation tests that occur before a cloud environment is automatically released:

* **Foreman Systems Validation** ensures that no target systems in your environment are marked for build.
* **VLAN Network Validation** ensures that all the backend interfaces in your isolated VLANs are reachable via fping

All of these validations are run from `--validate-env` and we also ship a few useful tools to help you figure out validation failures.

`--validate-env` is run from cron, see our [example cron entry](cron/quads)

### Troubleshooting Steps
You should run through each of these steps manually to determine what systems/networks might need attention of automated validation does not pass in a reasonable timeframe.  Typically, `admin_cc:` will receieve email notifications of trouble hosts as well.


* **General Availability** can be checked via a simple `fping` command, this should be run first.

```bash
quads --cloud-only --cloud cloud23 > /tmp/cloud23
fping -u -f /tmp/cloud23
```

* **Foreman Systems Validation** can be run via the hammer cli command provided by `gem install hammer_cli_foreman_admin hammer_cli`

```bash
for host in $(quads --cloud-only --cloud cloud15) ; do echo $host $(hammer host info --name $host | grep -i build); done
```

No systems should be left marked for build.

### Validation using Debug Mode
* **NOTE** Automated validation **will not** start until 2 hours after the assignment is scheduled to go out, until this point `--validate-env` will not attempt to validate any systems if run and they have started less than 2 hours ago.
  - This can be set via the `validation_grace_period:` setting in `/opt/quads/conf/quads.yml`

* `--validate-env` now has a `--debug` option which tells you what's happening during validation.
* This will test the backend network connectivity part and the entire set of checks.

* **Successful Validation** looks like this:

```bash
quads --validate-env --debug
```

```

### Skipping Past Network Validation

* You can skip past network validation via:

```bash
quads --validate-env --skip-network
```

### Skipping Past Host and Systems Validation

* You can skip past systems and host validation (Foreman) via:

```
quads --validate-env --skip-system
```

### Skipping Past Network and Systems Validation per Host

* You can skip past both systems and network checks per host via:

```
quads --validate-env --skip-hosts host01.example.com host02.example.com
```

* Effectively, any host listed with `--skip-hosts` will pass it completely through validation.
* This can be used in combination with `--skip-system` and `--skip-network` as well.

### Validate Only a Specific Cloud

* If you want to validate only a certain cloud you can do so by specifying the cloud's name with the `--cloud` flag.
```bash
quads --validate-env --cloud cloud01
```

### Mapping Internal VLAN Interfaces to Problem Hosts
You might have noticed that we configure our [Foreman](/templates/foreman) templates to drop `172.{16,17,18,19}.x` internal VLAN interfaces which correspond to the internal, QUADS-managed multi-tenant interfaces across a set of hosts in a cloud assignment.

The _first two octets_ here can be substituted by the _first two octets of your systems public network_ in order to determine from `quads --validate-env --debug` which host internal interfaces have issues or are unreachable.

![validation_1](/image/troubleshoot_validation1.png?raw=true)

* Above, we can run the `host` command to determine what these machines map to by substituting `10.1` for the first two octects:

```
# for host in 10.1.37.231 10.1.38.150; do host $host; done
231.37.1.10.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer e17-h26-b04-fc640.example.com.
150.38.1.10.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer e17-h26-b03-fc640.example.com.
```

* Below you can see the code that maintains this mapping and assumptions:

![validation_2](/image/troubleshoot_validation2.png?raw=true)

This mapping feeds into the environment validator plugin's VLAN network validation code

### Dealing with the Postgres Database
* Everything QUADS does is done inside the PostgreSQL database, occasionally you may want to adjust settings here.
* Below is a working example of manually setting the `validated` flag at the cloud level to force `--validate-env` to process it.
* Doing this is rare if at all needed but keeping this here for reference and posterity.

> [!WARNING]
> Before making changes to your database make sure you [have a backup](#backing-up-quads)

#### Connecting to the Postgres Database
  - Connect to postgres
```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```
  - Connect to the QUADS database
```sql
postgres=# \c quads;
You are now connected to database "quads" as user "postgres".
```
#### Basic Investigation for Validation
  - Find the ID of your problem environment
```sql
quads=# select * from clouds where name = 'cloud17';
 id |  name   |   last_redefined
----+---------+---------------------
 18 | cloud17 | 2024-10-01 06:00:00
(1 row)
```
  - Look at the flags set for that environment, specifically `provisioned` if it's `f` or `t` (true or false)
```sql
quads=# select * from assignments where cloud_id = 18;
```

```sql
 id | active | provisioned | validated |   description    |  owner  | ticket | qinq | wipe |
                                                                         | cloud_id | vlan_id |        created_at
----+--------+-------------+-----------+------------------+---------+--------+------+------+-------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------+---------+--------------------------
 54 | t      | f           | f         | template testing | wfoster | 3798   |    0 | t    | \x80059545000000000000008c1673716c616c6368656d792e6578
654c6973749493945d94288c0767726166756c73948c066b616d62697a9465859452942e |       18 |         | 2024-10-01 06:00:07.0437
(1 row)
```
  - Now toggle the `provisioned` flag to True (`t`)
```sql
quads=# update assignments set provisioned = true where id = 54;
UPDATE 1
```
  - Check one more time, it should have updated.
```sql
quads=# select * from assignments where cloud_id = 18;
 id | active | provisioned | validated |   description    |  owner  | ticket | qinq | wipe |
                                                                         | cloud_id | vlan_id |        created_at
----+--------+-------------+-----------+------------------+---------+--------+------+------+-------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------+---------+--------------------------
 54 | t      | t           | f         | template testing | wfoster | 3798   |    0 | t    | \x80059545000000000000008c1673716c616c6368656d792e6578
654c6973749493945d94288c0767726166756c73948c066b616d62697a9465859452942e |       18 |         | 2024-10-01 06:00:07.0437
(1 row)
```
  - Now your new assignment should get proper attention from `quads --validate-env`

#### Forcing Hosts to Move Clouds
* Scenario:  You have two hosts that have recently been retired and removed but they never got a chance to move back to the default cloud or spare pool according to QUADS e.g. `cloud01` or `cloud_id: 1`.  Their out-of-band interfaces are unreachable so QUADS will never complete their move so it will continue to try over and over again.
* Solution: Enter the database and manually set the `cloud_id` for each host to `cloud_id: 1`

  - First determine the destination `cloud_id` is correct:

```sql
quads=# select * from clouds where name = 'cloud01';
```
```
 id |  name   |       last_redefined
----+---------+----------------------------
  1 | cloud01 | 2024-08-14 14:14:26.940415
(1 row)
```

  - Next, set the `cloud_id: 1` for each problem host.

```sql
quads=# update hosts set cloud_id=1 where name = 'e22-h24-b04-fc640.rdu2.example.com';
quads=# update hosts set cloud_id=1 where name = 'e22-h24-b02-fc640.rdu2.example.com';
```
  - Now you should see that `quads --move-hosts --dry-run` has nothing to do!

#### Forcing Switch Config Applied
Occasionally `python3-paramiko` or some switch/connectivity issue may keep the switch plugin from properly setting the `switch_config_applied` value for some of your hosts.  This typically elicits the following error during `--validate-env`

```
Validating cloud18
Host: f30-h15-000-r640.example.com
The following hosts are missing switch configuration:
f30-h15-000-r640.example.com
```

* To fix this you'll need to get into the database:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```
```sql
postgres=# \c quads;
You are now connected to database "quads" as user "postgres".
```

* Now find the host(s) `id` you want to adjust for `switch_config_applied`

```sql
quads=# select id from hosts where name = 'f30-h15-000-r640.example.com';
  id
------
 1926
(1 row)
```

* Finally, set the value to true:

```sql
quads=*# update hosts set switch_config_applied=true where id=1926;
UPDATE 1
```

* You can also set this at the entire cloud level.

```sql
select * from clouds where name = 'cloud11';
 id |  name   |   last_redefined
----+---------+---------------------
 12 | cloud11 | 2026-04-23 16:15:00
```

```sql
update hosts set switch_config_applied = true where cloud_id = 12;
```

> [!NOTE]
> First physically verify/fix your configurations with `quads --verify-switch-conf --cloud cloud0X`
>
> All your hosts should validate now assuming this value is set properly.

#### Cleaning up Orphaned Active Assignments
Sometimes failed attempts to use the self-scheduling API and workflows may result in orphaned, active assignments with no host schedules associated with it.

> [!CAUTION]
> It's very important to clear empty, active assignments as they will continue to consume the QUADS cloud/environment and hold it hostage unless they are marked inactive.

* In [RFE #605](https://github.com/quadsproject/quads/issues/605) we'll look to address this automatically as a maintenance task or scheduling mechanic but for now this must be done in the database.

##### Finding Orphaned Assignments
```sql
quads=# select a.id, a.description from assignments a left join schedules s on a.id = s.assignment_id where a.active = true and s.id is null;
```

You'll see the following output if there are any matches:

```
 id |              description
----+----------------------------------------
 59 | Temporary allocation from openshift-ci
(1 row)
```

* We can see `schedule_id` `59` is abandoned, having no host schedules yet they are still flagged as active.

##### Removing Orphaned Active Assignments
```sql
quads=# update assignments set active = false where id = 59;
UPDATE 1
```

##### Finding and Inactivating All Orphaned Active Assignments
The following query will find and inactivate all orphaned active assignments in one swoop.

```sql
quads=# UPDATE assignments a SET active = FALSE WHERE a.active = TRUE AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM schedules s WHERE s.assignment_id = a.id);
```

#### Deleting Self Service Users
* Ideally you should be using `flask` to [remove users](#user-management) but this can be done in the database too.

To delete a user, e.g. if `user1@example.com` has a forgotten password, delete user to allow re-registering.
```bash
echo "select id,email from users;" | sudo -u postgres psql -d quads | grep user1@example.com
```

Above, we get the return here of `15 | user1@example.com`

Notice the `id` value of `15` for the user to delete.  First delete the `roles_users` entry:
```bash
echo "delete from roles_users where user_id = 15;" | sudo -u postgres psql -d quads
```
Next, delete the `users` entry:
```bash
echo "delete from users where email like 'user1%';" | sudo -u postgres psql -d quads
```
